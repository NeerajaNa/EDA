# **Earthquake Data Analysis (1995 - 2023) 🌍📊**  

## **Overview**  
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on earthquake data from **1995 to 2023** to identify trends, patterns, and insights into earthquake occurrences worldwide.  

## **Dataset**  
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Time Period:** 1995 - 2023  
- **Features:** Date, Time, Location, Magnitude, Depth, Country, etc.  

## **Objectives**  
✔ Analyze earthquake frequency over time (yearly, monthly, daily, and hourly).  
✔ Identify the most affected countries and regions.  
✔ Examine magnitude distribution and trends.  
✔ Explore correlations between time and earthquake magnitude.  
✔ Provide insights for potential earthquake prediction.  

## **Key Findings**  
📌 **Temporal Trends:** Earthquakes occur year-round, with notable fluctuations in frequency.  
📌 **Geographical Insights:** Some countries experience significantly more earthquakes than others.  
📌 **Magnitude Analysis:** Certain areas have consistently higher earthquake magnitudes.  
📌 **Correlation Insights:** Patterns between time and magnitude offer clues for prediction models.  

## **Technologies Used**  
🔹 **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
🔹 **Data Visualization** (Bar plots, Count plots, Line charts, Heatmaps)
